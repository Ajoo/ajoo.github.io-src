What is software defined radio

# A Cheap SDR

There are many commercially available SDRs, both receiver only (RX) and transceiver (RX/TX), but they're in general rather expensive (>$100 for RX and >$300 for RX/TX). This is where DVB-T TV tuner USB dongles based on the RTL2832U chipset come into play. As the name indicates, these cheap dongles (~$20) were meant for receiving DVB-T TV but hacked drivers from [Osmocom](http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr) are able to turn them into wideband receiver only SDRs. This cheap SDR is therefore tipically known as the RTL-SDR and in the next section we'll see what they're made of.

The RTL-SDR blog's [about](http://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/) page is a great source of further information about this awesome piece of hardware.
