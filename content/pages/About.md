# About Me

I'm an aerospace engineer from Portugal that is mostly interested in Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC), robotics and statistics/machine learning (with a focus on dynamical systems).

# About This Blog

I've started this blog as a way to document my personal projects, thoughts and research in what is hopefully an informative way. In the immediate future you can probably expect post-mortems on my kaggle competition participations and my exploits into software defined radio (SDR).
